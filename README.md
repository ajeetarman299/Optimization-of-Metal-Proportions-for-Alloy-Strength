Objective: Developed an ML framework optimizing alloy compositions for fatigue strength, tackling industrial metallurgical challenges

• Preprocessed alloy data with EDA, imputation & normalization; used metal proportions as features and fatigue strength as target variable

• Evaluated & tuned ML models, achieving 91.7% train & 88.5% validation accuracy with CatBoost, showing robust predictive performance

• Utilized GridSearch with CatBoost to find optimal metal proportions to achieve desired alloy strength & design improving cost efficiency# Optimization-of-Metal-Proportions-for-Alloy-Strength
